# Business-Intelligence-Dashboard-for-Campus-Vendor-Selection
---

## Introduction
This Power BI dashboard was developed as part of a real-world marketing analytics initiative at my university, where I work as a Marketing Data Analyst. The project aimed to evaluate student feedback from a tasting event hosted by 'Zaro’s Bakery, NYC', a potential replacement for the existing vendor-Starbucks on campus.

The dataset consists of student reviews collected through a structured survey, capturing their ratings of Zaro’s baked goods and coffee, likelihood to visit if Zaro’s opened on campus, and open-ended comments. The goal was to provide university's decision-makers with a data-driven recommendation based on student sentiment and preferences.

Using Power BI, I transformed raw feedback into interactive visualizations, performed sentiment analysis using Python, and built a dashboard that clearly communicates student opinions and supports strategic decision-making. This project demonstrates my ability to apply business intelligence tools to solve operational challenges and influence stakeholder decisions.

I have attached detailed steps and screenshots of the project in a blog: [Link to the Blog](https://akankshawagh.medium.com/business-intelligence-dashboard-for-campus-vendor-selection-b84945ef323a)

## Visualizations

- Baked Goods Rating: How Did Students Rate Zaro’s Baked Goods?

- Coffee Rating: Student Feedback on Zaro’s Coffee Quality

- Influence of Family-Owned Business: Does Zaro’s Family-Owned Legacy Influence Student Choices?

- Likelihood to Visit: Would Students Visit Zaro’s If It Opened on Campus?

- Sentiment Analysis of Comments: What Are Students Saying About Zaro’s?

  NOTE: For Sentiment Analysis of Comments, I used Python script inside Power BI. I have attached the script in Python Script.txt file. This code generated 2 extra columns for sentiment analysis, Sentiment_Score: A number between -1 and +1 and Sentiment_Category: Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

- Sentimant vs Likelihood to visit: See if students who left positive comments are more likely to visit Zaro’s.
