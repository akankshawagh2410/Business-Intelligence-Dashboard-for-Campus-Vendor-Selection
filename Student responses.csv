It is also a bit dry, but that is to be expected from a prepackaged cookie. Biggest complaint is a lack of chocolate flavor from the chocolate side, as it is hard to taste the difference between the sides. The raspberry rugelach is fantastic, it‚Äôs not too sweet thankfully. Only criticism is that it isn‚Äôt flakey but that is to be expected. "
